## Abstract

This HIP describe how to publish a wallet address in a domain.

## Motivation

Wallet address are not human friendly. Sending an address normally involves "copy & paste" and is near to impossible to do via voice channels.

Since Handshare is all about owning domains, we could use them as alias to our wallet address.

### Protocol

The basics of this protocol consists in serving the address in an HTTPS request to the [.well-known diretory](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8615). For security reasons, we should only HTTPS.

The address should be located at `https://<domain>/.well-known/wallets/SYMBOL`.

For instance `https://example/.well-known/wallets/HNS`.

### Dynamic or Static

This proposal doesn't define if the content served should be static (file in the disk) or dynamic (unique address per request).

### Security Concerns

Requests should be made using only HTTPS. Handshake's HTTPS requests are secured by DANE & PoW.

### Non HNS domain

This protocol can also be used with non-HNS domains (aka ICANN).

In this case, the security would rely on CA. It should be a consumer choice to accept it or not.

### Non cryptocurrency address

It's also possible to define a non-crypto symbol, such as `/.well-known/wallets/USD`, which should return an [IBAN](https://www.iso.org/standard/41031.html).
