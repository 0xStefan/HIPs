## Abstract

This HIP describes how to set the data for a Handshake name so that it can resolved via an external namespace or alternative consensus system.
Resolution must be performed by an extension to a Handshake resolver which may not be included by default in full or light clients.

## Motivation

There may be various reasons to resolve a name on an alternative namespace other than a domain name or an name server hosted on an IP address.
One example is decentralized subdomains: software could recognize the special records for an HNS name and resolve the user query on an external system,
where protocol rules allow for censorship-resistant subdomain registration, relieving those domain owners of parent-zone risk.

## Name data standard

External resolution is triggered by setting a special NS record for a Handshake name.
The `ns` value must end in a name that is invalid or otherwise blocked by the Handshake root name server.
For example, names that begin with an underscore are normally invalid, and names like `.bit` and `.eth` are normally blocked.
The invalid "top level domain" of the `ns` record is referred to as the HIP-5 **`protocol`**.

Any additional labels in the `ns` field are treated as protocol-specific inputs for the external resolver,
and are referred to as the HIP-5 **`data`**.

This is an example of a Handshake name resource that should trigger external resolution with a compatible plug-in:

```
{
  "records": [{
    "type": "NS",
    "ns": "0x36fc69f0983E536D1787cC83f481581f22CCA2A1._eth."
  }]
}
```

In this example, the **`protocol`** is `_eth` which corresponds to "EIP-137 compatible Ethereum contract."
The **`data`** is `0x36fc69f0983E536D1787cC83f481581f22CCA2A1` which corresponds to an "Ethereum contract address."

## External name resolution for Handshake TLDs

To execute this protocol, a Handshake root nameserver must inspect its own responses to all queries.
If it detects a compatible NS record in the response to a query, the software extension should resolve
**the initial query string** using the external protocol defined by the NS record. The plug-in is effectively
a recursive resolver inside the HNS root zone.

Example dialog between user, their recursive resolver, the HNS root resolver, and the HIP-5 plug-in.
Notice how the plugin intercepts the _response_ from the root name server.

`?` denotes queries, `!` denotes responses and `A` / `NS` are DNS record types.

## Direct resolution of external namespace

Because the Handshake resolver is running with a protocol extension plug-in, it should also
be possible for that same software to resolve alternative namespaces outside of Handshake referrals.
This mechanism is not really a feature of HIP-5 but is included here as a recommendation for software
implementing this HIP.

Example of direct ENS resolution using HIP-5 extended Handshake resolver.
Note how the `.eth` suffix resolves using the official ENS contract.

```sh
$ dig brantly.eth +short
120.240.32.33
```

## Registered protocols

| data | suffix | protocol |
|-|-|-|
| Ethereum contract address | `._eth` | [EIP-137](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-137) ENS-compatible contract deployed on Ethereum |
| ENS subdomain | `.eth` | Official ENS contract deployed on Ethereum |
