## Abstract

We propose a method for generating application-specific script address using a different branch based on BIP44.

## Motivation

Secondary market protocol, like Shakedex, currently generate a new private key for each script address, which make recovery possible as users have to back up multiple keys. By generating script address using same seed, we can recover the user's auction listing and pending fills by importing the seed.

### BIP32 path generation

Recall from [BIP32](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki)
that keys are derived from a series of 4-byte indexes. Indexes lower than `0x7fffffff`
are derived using non-hardened derivation, which is required if an algorithm
only has access to the public key.


#### Example

Based on the following HD path:

```
m / purpose' / coin_type' / account' / branch / address_index 
```

We propose standardizing the `branch` path for different usages:
- `0`: receive address (default)
- `1`: change address (default)
- `7562348`: shakedex locking script (based on [Gohan](https://github.com/kurumiimari/gohan/blob/master/shakedex/constants.go#L4) and [Bob Wallet](https://github.com/kyokan/bob-wallet/pull/416))
