## Abstract

We propose an ascending-price auction system for HNS domain names without trust or
third-party custody. A name owner initiates an auction by locking their TLD with
a verifiable script. Bidders place bids by partially-signing `TRANSFER` transactions,
and the name owner eventually picks the highest bid and atomically swaps the name
ownership for the payment. The protocol requires more interactivity and centralization
than the current Shakedex-style HIP-0001 auction format, but with some compelling trade-offs.

## Definitions

This proposal is based on [HIP-0001](https://hsd-dev.org/HIPs/proposals/0001/), and
in particular the Swap Script, Transaction Structure, and Swap Proof. Handshake
primitives like `OP_TYPE` and `SIGHASH_SINGLEREVERSE` are also required.

Recall the HIP-0001 Swap Script only allows two covenant actions be applied to the name:

- The name owner can sign a TRANSFER with their private key

- Anyone can FINALIZE without a signature

## Protocol Summary

### Auction OPEN

The auction technically begins when a name owner FINALIZEs a transfer of their name
to a HIP-0001 locking script. The name owner must then publicly reveal the redeem script
for the address that owns the name, so it can be verified. The locking script prevents
the name owner from canceling an in-progress name ownership transfer. Since there is a
small amount of interactivity required in the protocol, the name owner must also publish
"where" the auction will take place. The auction "location" is just some internet endpoint
where bidders can submit bids. It can be a private email address (in which case the name owner
may choose to keep all bids confidential or truly blind), or it can be a public server
that announces every new bid as they arrive.

### Auction BID

A user that wants to bid on the name constructs a partially-signed transaction in
the following format:

```
vin:
  0: current name owner, encumbered by Swap Script
  1: A UTXO controlled by the bidder of some value V
vout:
  0: TRANSFER to the bidder's address
```

Input 1 is signed with `SIGHASH_ANYONECANPAY | SIGHASH_SINGLEREVERSE`. This commits
the incoming payment to the name transfer. Note that Input 0 is not signed yet,
but it must be the current name-owning UTXO or the linked output 0 would be invalid.

Note that this transaction has no change output. Because the bidder is signing
with single-reverse, they can't specify a change output in addition to the name
transfer output. If they were to sign with `SIGHASH_ALL` then the next step of
the protocol would not be possible. If they signed with `SIGHASH_SINGLE` they could
commit to a change address, but not the name transfer.

Having no change output means the INPUT coin they are spending MUST BE THE VALUE
OF THE BID THEY INTEND TO PLACE ON THE NAME. This is a big inconvenience
that can be solved in at least these two ways:

- The user prepares their wallet in advance and collects UTXOs with a range
of values (1 HNS, 10 HNS, 100 HNS, 1000 HNS, etc).

- When the user wants to bid, their wallet creates a "perfect" UTXO by spending
to itself, creating a coin with the exact value desired. This output can be used
(even before it is confirmed) in this protocol.

### Auction FINALIZE

The name owner collects partially-signed bids and after some time, declares the highest
value bid the winner. The name owner completes the auction by adding a payment output
to the partially-signed transaction, signing and broadcasting:

```
vin:
  0: current name owner, encumbered by Swap Script
  1: A UTXO controlled by the bidder of some value V
vout:
  0: TRANSFER to the bidder's address
  1: payment to the name-owner
```

The name owner pays themselves from the fully funded transaction, and signs input 0
with `SIGHASH_ALL`. This transaction is a valid atomic swap and can be broadcast to the network.
Because the locking script prevents all other name actions, the auction winner can
`FINALIZE` this name transfer any time after the 288-block lockout without any other
obligation.

Note that since the bidder creates the INPUT and the name owner creates the OUTPUT,
the name owner MUST also pay the miner fee for this transaction. They do so by reducing
the value of output 1, effectively paying the miner fee out of the money they earned
by the sale.

## Extra Notes

### Bids must remain valid off-chain

The partially-signed bid transactions are collected by the name owner and commit
to spending a UTXO of some value V from the blockchain. In the simplest construction,
nothing prevents the bidder from invalidating this off-chain transaction by
double-spending the coin they used to bid. For this reason, the name owner must
routinely check that all submitted bids are still valid. They can try finalizing
the highest bid and if that fails, try to finalize the second-highest bid, etc.
More advanced constructions may be possible to more effectively prevent this
(lightning-network-style multisigs come to mind).

### A semi-custodial platform could help ensure auction finality

One possible scenario with this protocol is that the name owner never finalizes
any bids. They might have decided a "reserve price" was not met or just changed
their mind about the sale. One technique that may be used to ensure bidders that
a winner will be chosen by a certain time is to include a trusted moderator.

Auctions could be held on a platform like Shakedex or run by an agency with a
good reputation like Namebase or Kyokan. This agent would publish a static public
key for their platform, and name owners would have to incorporate that key along
with a relative locktime into the HIP-0001 locking script like so:

```
OP_TYPE
0x09 // TRANSFER
OP_EQUAL
OP_IF
  OP_IF
    <name-owner's public key>
  OP_ELSE
    <timespan of auction>
    OP_CSV
    OP_DROP
    <platform's public key>
  OP_ENDIF
  OP_CHECKSIG
OP_ELSE
  OP_TYPE
  0x0a // FINALIZE
  OP_EQUAL
OP_ENDIF
```

What this does is add a rule to the locking script such that, after a certain amount
of time (i.e. 5 days) the platform operator can finalize the auction with their own
private key instead of waiting for the name owner to do so. Technically this means that if
the name owner does not finalize the auction in time (or simply transfer the name back to
themselves -- publicly ending the auction on the blockchain) the platform can
_steal the name OR the value of the highest bid_. In some cases, this may be the actual
terms-of-service. In more common cases we can assume a platform with interest in
maintaining a good reputation would award the highest bidder with the name and
pay the name owner from output 1 of the final transaction.

### Where & When

Because this auction protocol is interactive, bidders need a place to send their
partially-signed transactions where they are accessible to the name owner to finalize.
A name owner could therefore open an auction by adding TXT records to their zone
announcing the endpoint to send bids, along with the redeem script to prove the name
is locked by HIP-0001! Once this UPDATE has been sent, users just need to wait
for the name owner to FINALIZE the transfer to the HIP-0001 address, and the auction is LIVE!
